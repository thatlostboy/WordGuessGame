Goals of Word Guess Game

Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.
 Display the following:
 Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).
 If the word is madonna, display it like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.
 As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: m a d o _  _ a.
 Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
 Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).
 After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.

Word Guess Game Bonuses added into code
 Play a sound or song when the user guesses their word correctly, like in our demo.
 Write some stylish CSS rules to make a design that fits your game's theme.
 HARD MODE: Organize your game code as an object, except for the key events to get the letter guessed. This will be a challenge if you haven't coded with JavaScript before, but we encourage anyone already familiar with the language to try this out.
